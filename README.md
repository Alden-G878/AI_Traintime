# AI_Traintime
Summary: Attempting to decrease the training time of reinforcement learning Artificial Intelligence. I use the OpenAI Gym enviornments and tensorflow, so the OpenAI Gym and tensorflow packages are required to run this program.

# Notes:
 - The current saved models are samples from my testing. They shouldn't be important, and are just the saving that happens by default. I have decided to not ignore the .h5 files, since it enables others to rapadly test loading models without having to spend the time running the training.
