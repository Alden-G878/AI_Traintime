# AI_Traintime
Summary: Attempting to decrease the training time of reinforcement learning Artificial Intelligence. I use the OpenAI Gym enviornments and tensorflow, so the OpenAI Gym and tensorflow packages are required to run this program.

# Notes:
 - The current saved models are samples from my testing. They shouldn't be important, and are just the saving that happens by default. I have decided to not ignore the .h5 files, since it enables others to rapadly test loading models without having to spend the time running the training.

 # How to Run:
 - In the 'Current' subfolder there are two python files, 'l_test_model.py' and 'l_test_loadtest.py'
 - The 'l_test_model.py' file is what is used to train the AI. Running the program should be fine (if there are no bugs), and to change the enviornment you should change the ENV_NAME variable.
